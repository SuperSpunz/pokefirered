## Merged branch of all my other branches

### Current Features
* Physical Special Split: Just the regular Physical Special Split ported from Gen IV
* Auto-Run:               Press R after getting the running shoes to toggle Auto-Run
* Register L:             Register Items to L (as well as Select)
* Bag-Sort:               Sort items in the bag by pressing Start
* Nature Colored Stats:   Stats on the Pokémon Summary Screen are colored based on the Pokémon's Nature
* Faster Indigo League:   Moved the entrance to the Indigo League, Made the E4 members move out of the way after battle, and allowed starting the battles from a tile away.
* Lvl 100 Evo Rare Candy: Can use a Rare Candy on an unevolved Pokémon to evolve them. (Levelup+ evolutions only)
* Shuckle Berry Juice:    A Shuckle in the Party holding a Berry will have a chance to turn it into Berry Juice at the end of a battle.

### Planned Features
* Infinite & Unsellable TMs:        Thought I had this working, but seems like it's not. I'll loop back around to it soon.
* Hidden Power Unhidden:            Show Hidden Power's Type and Power in the Summary Screen and Battles. The "Hidden-Power-type-in-Summary-Screen" branch is working, but I want to get the Power shown before I add it here. Battle screen is another task I'll look into soon.
* Show IVs EVs in Summary:          I want to port this from pokeemerald, but it seems like a pretty large task.
* Display Return/Frustration Power: Display the current power of Return and Frustration in the Summary Screen.
* Modern Premier Balls:             When buying 10+ PokéBalls, Merchants will give 1 Premier Ball. I want to update it to give 1 for each 10 bought (2 premier for 20-29 bought, 3 premier for 30-39 bought, etc.)
* HMs without party knowing:        Allow the use of HMs without consuming a move slot on party Pokémon
